              Description. Bembex Lab Service is an online service where
              individuals or entities that have signed up with Bembex Lab as
              clients (each, a "Client") can post specific assignments and
              project descriptions, including illustrative samples or other
              media (each, a "Creative Brief"), revise those Creative Briefs
              (each, a "Revision Brief") and obtain responses (each, a
              "Response") to those Creative or Revision Briefs from design
              experts retained by Bembex Lab ("Members"). Bembex Lab will
              provide you, as the Client, the Service according to the Package
              you have chosen as detailed in section 1(e) below. Your Responses
              will be created iteratively through a drafting cycle of Creative
              Briefs, Revision Briefs and Responses, ultimately resulting in a
              final Response conforming to your various Creative and Revision
              Briefs.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Creative Brief and Responses. You are solely responsible for
              preparing and posting detailed descriptions of each of your
              Creative Briefs to the Web Site, including providing samples
              illustrating your Creative Brief and any relevant deadlines. For
              each Response to a Creative Brief that you want to receive, a term
              sheet (a "Term Sheet") will be generated that will contain, and be
              subject to, the terms and conditions you have established for the
              Creative or Revision Brief. Bembex Lab is under no obligation to
              review a Creative or Revision Brief or Term Sheet for any purpose,
              including accuracy, completeness of information, quality or
              clarity. Bembex Lab may decide, in its sole discretion, to deny a
              Creative or Revision Brief or a Term Sheet.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Reviewing Responses. When Bembex Lab provides you with a Response,
              you are responsible for reviewing the Response. If you fail to
              promptly inform Bembex Lab that the Response is not reasonably
              responsive to the related Term Sheet or Creative Brief, you will
              be deemed to have accepted the Response. If you notify Bembex Lab
              that you think a Response is not reasonably responsive to the
              related Creative Brief, you shall then submit to the Web Site a
              Revision Brief containing information regarding amendments or
              modification to be made to the initial Response. After you provide
              Bembex Lab with a Revision Brief, Bembex Lab will provide you with
              a subsequent Response that conforms to the additional criteria you
              requested. Bembex Lab is not responsible for the content of
              Responses developed to the extent that such Responses are prepared
              to conform to your Creative or Revision Briefs.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Revision Cycles. Revision cycles generally consist of unlimited
              additional compositions that incorporate changes you request in a
              Revision Brief. The purpose of the revision process is to create
              Responses that move your project forward in the specific direction
              you have determined. You may request significant changes in the
              first and second cycles, and the Responses generated might be
              quite different in nature from the original composition you
              selected. By the third revision request, your requests shall be
              modifications of the current composition only. Revision requests
              that depart from the then-current composition will be honored and
              completed in a timely manner, however; Bembex Lab reserves the
              right to charge the client for each such Revision. No revision
              work, which requires payment, will be started without your
              authorization.

              billing address when registering as a Client. You will receive
              receipts for all your transactions with Bembex Lab. We hold the
              right to change the fee policy for Clients and impose additional
              fees on Clients at any time; however, such additional fees will
              not apply to projects submitted before Bembex Lab decides to
              implement any such changes in fees.
